# Splitter app

The Splitter app is designed to simplify and streamline the process of splitting expenses and managing shared costs among groups of people. Whether itâ€™s for a group trip, shared household expenses, group dining, or any situation where costs need to be divided, Splitter makes it easy and efficient

In this project, I have used Android with Kotlin, MVVM, Dagger Hilt, Coroutines, Room, Firebase & Android JetPack.
